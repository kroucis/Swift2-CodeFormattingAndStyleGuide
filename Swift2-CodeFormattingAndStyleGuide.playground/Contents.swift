## Preable
Everyone speaks differently. Everyone writes differently. Everyone constructs sentences differently. Everyone writes code differently. Simple facts of life. However, establishing conventions and styleguides helps collaborators create more efficiently. I (Kyle Roucis) present my own personal styleguide for generation of Swift 2 code in this document. It flies in the face of established conventions at times, and otherwise outlines the obvious. Even with these flaws, I hope that this guide will spurn discussion and hopefully make collaborating with me on future projects easier. Please feel free to contact me with regards to this guide by email at kyle (amphora) kyleroucis (dot) com.

# Terminology
## CapsCase
`ThisIsCapsCase`
## camelCase
`thisIsCamelCase`
## under_case
`this_is_under_case`
## SCREAM_CASE
`THIS_IS_SCREAM_CASE`
## stdcase
`thisisstdcase`
# Brace Style
## New-line Braces
New-line braces are used for language-level constructs. This includes
* Type declarations
* Control-flow blocks (`if`/`while`/`do`/`catch`/etc.)
* Method/function bodies
### Rationale
This promotes an easily readable 'block' of code, neatly organizing each scope created by constructs in the language. This helps to differentiate from closures and to easily allow readers to see how execution flows at a glance without having to skim for keywords.

## Same-line Braces
Same-line braces are used for closures. This includes
* Trailing closures for functions/methods.
* Stand-alone closure declarations.
Closure arguments and return type is declared on the same line as the brace.
### Rationale
This differentiates closures from function bodies, type declarations, and other 'static' declarations that are not generally a part of the run-time of the program. This also helps to associate trailing closures with their function calls in a concise manner.

# Naming Conventions
## Types
Custom types are named using CapsCase. These types include
* Classes
* Structs
* Protocols
* Enum Names
* Enum Cases
* `typealias`-es
### Rationale
This follows much of Apple's style and differentiates constant, high-level types from local vars.

## Classes, Structs, and Enums
First-class types such as classes, structs, and enums are declared with a space between the type name and the required `:`, and a space between the `:` and any super types. Each comma in the list of supertypes/protocols is followed by a space. For generic types, their is _NO SPACE_ between the generic brace `<` and the type declaration. There is a space after each comma in a generic declaration list. For generic type arguments with restrictions, there is a space between the restricting type and the `:`, but _NO SPACE_ between the type name and the `:`.
(_Optional but preferred_): There is an extra newline between the last brace for method declarations in a class and the closing brace for the class itself.
### Rationale
This spacing helps readability and differentiates class declarations from other type annotations while still utilizing that type annotation idiom where appropriate for generics.

## Functions and Methods
Functions and methods have a space after each comma separating arguments. There is space between the parens and the `throws` annotation. There is a space between the parens or throw and the return arrow `->`. There is a space between the return arrow `->` and the return type. For generic functions/methods, their is _NO SPACE_ between the generic brace `<` and the type declaration. There is a space after each comma in a generic declaration list. For generic type arguments with restrictions, there is a space between the restricting type and the `:`, but _NO SPACE_ between the type name and the `:`.

This spacing helps to call out the return type and throwing annotation of the function and follow type annotations for variables.

## Closures
Like functions, closures have spaces between `throws` annotation, return arrow `->`, and return type.

# Variables and Data
## `var` And `let`
Constants and variables that need type annotations have a space after the `:`, but _NO SPACE_ before the `:`. This include variable declarations in functions/method/closure argument lists. For assignment, there is a space between the `var`/`let` name or class annotation and the `=`, and there is a space after the `=` to the next expression.
### Rationale
This differentiates type annotations from Dictionary key-value pairs and helps readability for the types involved in computation.

## Literals
Array and Dictionary literals have a space between the opening brace, the first element, the last element, and the closing brace.

For a Dictionary literal, there is a space between each key and the `:`, and a space after the `:` to the value.

This gives elements, which may be very complex, breathing room as well as facilitating readability even when code highlighting is not available.
